This repository contains examples, to help establish and illustrate an ontology of layout analysis and segmentation.

There are three sections.

## Sources

Examples of sources, with all their possible zones.

Each submission is made in a separate folder, and contains:

- an image file;
- a markdown file, describing the different zones and lines that are encountered, and signaling issues;
- (NOT FOR NOW): an Alto file implementing the example in the ontology. 

## Zones

- a markdown file, containing a definition and listing problems;

## Lines

Examples of lines, one folder for each zone type, containing: 

- a markdown file, containing a definition and listing problems;
